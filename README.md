# The English School Elections Platform üó≥Ô∏è

Welcome to the official and unbiased platform for The English School elections - [eselections.org](https://www.eselections.org)!

## Overview
This platform was designed with transparency and fairness in mind, providing every candidate an equal opportunity to showcase their capabilities and vision. Not only does it serve as a digital campaign ground, but it also streamlines the voting process, ensuring each vote counts.

## Features
- **Candidate Profiles**: An equal space for all candidates to advertise and showcase themselves.
- **Secure Voting**: For the elections, every eligible voter received an email with a unique link to ensure one personx, one vote.
- **Transparency**: The results, though heart-breaking for some (yes, I'm looking at myself üòÇ), are displayed without any bias.

## Personal Note
I also ran as a candidate. Spoiler: I didn't win. (Haha)
